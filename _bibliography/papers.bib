  html = {https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/105432},
  abstract = {Across the tree of life, distinct designs of cellular membranes have evolved. In bacteria and eukaryotes single-headed lipids self-assemble into flexible bilayer membranes. By contrast, archaea often possess double-headed, monolayer spanning bolalipids, mixed with bilayer lipids, enabling them to survive in harsh environments. Here, using a minimal computational model for bolalipid membranes, we discover trade-offs when forming membranes. We find that membranes made out of flexible bolalipids resemble bilayer membranes as bolalipids exhibit conformational switch into U-shaped conformations to enable higher curvatures. Conversely, stiffer bolalipids, resembling those in extremophile archaea, take on straight conformations and form liquid membranes that are stiff, and prone to pore formation during membrane reshaping. Strikingly, we show how to achieve fluid bolalipid membranes that are both stable and flexible – by including small amounts of bilayer lipids, as archaea do. Our study explains how different organisms resolve trade-offs when generating membranes of desired material properties.},

  abstract = {Multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) sequester membrane proteins destined for degradation within intralumenal vesicles (ILVs), a process mediated by the membrane-remodeling action of Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins. In Arabidopsis, endosomal membrane constriction and scission are uncoupled, resulting in the formation of extensive concatenated ILV networks and enhancing cargo sequestration efficiency. Here, we used a combination of electron tomography, computer simulations, and mathematical modeling to address the questions of when concatenated ILV networks evolved in plants and what drives their formation. Through morphometric analyses of tomographic reconstructions of endosomes across yeast, algae, and various land plants, we have found that ILV concatenation is widespread within plant species, but only prevalent in seed plants, especially in flowering plants. Multiple budding sites that require the formation of pores in the limiting membrane were only identified in hornworts and seed plants, suggesting that this mechanism has evolved independently in both plant lineages. To identify the conditions under which these multiple budding sites can arise, we used particle-based molecular dynamics simulations and found that changes in ESCRT filament properties, such as filament curvature and membrane binding energy, can generate the membrane shapes observed in multiple budding sites. To understand the relationship between membrane budding activity and ILV network topology, we performed computational simulations and identified a set of membrane remodeling parameters that can recapitulate our tomographic datasets.},

  abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the main pathway used by eukaryotic cells to take up extracellular material, but the dominant physical mechanisms driving this process are still elusive. Recently, several high-resolution imaging techniques have been used on different cell lines to measure the geometrical properties of clathrin-coated pits over their whole lifetime. Here, we first show that the combination of all datasets with the recently introduced cooperative curvature model defines a consensus pathway, which is characterized by a flat-to-curved transition at finite area, followed by linear growth and subsequent saturation of curvature. We then apply an energetic model for the composite of the plasma membrane and clathrin coat to this consensus pathway to show that the dominant mechanism for invagination could be coat stiffening, which might originate from cooperative interactions between the different clathrin molecules and progressively drives the system toward its intrinsic curvature. Our theory predicts that two length scales determine the invagination pathway, namely the patch size at which the flat-to-curved transition occurs and the final pit radius.},

  abstract = {All biological cells are enclosed by a fluid membrane and have to continuously transport information and material across this interface. Cells have developed multiple strategies by which they take up small particles. In this thesis, I use theoretical models from statistical physics and computer simulations to investigate two of these strategies, namely receptor-mediated endocytosis driven by adhesion energy and clathrin-mediated endocytosis driven by the polymerisation energy of supramolecular assembly. For receptor-mediated uptake, I focus on systems with sizes in the order of 10 − 300 nm, few tens of cell surface receptors and address stochastic effects. We show how the stochastic dynamics of uptake is influenced by particle geometry and compare theoretically predicted adhesion energies to experimental data. For clathrin-mediated endocytosis we demonstrate by combining different experimental data sets with physical models how clathrin triskelia assemble and rearrange during endocytosis. Using computer simulations we show that flat clathrin lattices grow sparsely and that an increasing clathrin density could drive a flat-to-curved transition of clathrin lattices. Together, these results demonstrate how physical models can help to understand the complex biological process of cellular uptake.},

It is well known that this leads to a minimal particle size for uptake. Using a simple deterministic theory for this process, we first show that, for the same radius and volume, cylindrical particles should be taken up faster than spherical particles, both for normal and parallel orientations. We then address stochastic effects, which are expected to be relevant due to small system size, and show that, now, spherical particles can have a faster uptake because the mean first passage time profits from the multiplicative noise induced by the spherical geometry. We conclude that stochastic effects are strongly geometry dependent and may favor spherical shapes during adhesion-driven particle uptake.},

Here we show that this barrier is similar to but different from an effective line tension and suggest a simple analytical approximation for it.

However, for fully assembled clathrin lattices high energetic and topological barriers exist for the flat-to-curved transition. Here we explore the possibility that flat clathrin lattices grow with vacancies that are not visible in traditional imaging techniques but would lower these barriers. We identify the Eden model for cluster growth as the most appropriate modeling framework and systematically derive the four possible variants that result from the specific architecture of the clathrin triskelion. Our computer simulations show that the different models lead to clear differences in the statistical distributions of cluster shapes and densities. Experimental results from electron microscopy and correlative light microscopy provide first indications for the model variants with a moderate level of lattice vacancies.},

Here, we combine correlative electron and light microscopy and mathematical growth laws to study the ultrastructural rearrangements of the clathrin coat during endocytosis in BSC-1 mammalian cells. We confirm that clathrin coats initially grow flat and demonstrate that curvature begins when around 70% of the final clathrin content is acquired. We find that this transition is marked by a change in the clathrin to clathrin-adaptor protein AP2 ratio and that membrane tension suppresses this transition. Our results support the notion that BSC-1 mammalian cells dynamically regulate the flat-to-curved transition in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by both biochemical and mechanical factors.},

Here we show that the forces exerted at the ventral side of adherent cells during reovirus uptake exceed the binding strength of biotin-neutravidin anchoring viruses to a biofunctionalized substrate. Analysis of virus dissociation kinetics using the Bell model revealed mean forces higher than 30 pN per virus, preferentially applied in the cell periphery where close matrix contacts form. Utilizing 100 nm-sized nanoparticles decorated with integrin adhesion motifs, we demonstrate that the uptake forces scale with the adhesion energy, while actin/myosin inhibitions strongly reduce the uptake frequency, but not uptake kinetics. We hypothesize that particle adhesion and the push by the substrate provide the main driving forces for uptake.},

From a continuum point of view, it can be driven by increases in coat stiffness, preferred curvature or line tension. Here we develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that can be solved analytically and that predicts the consequences of these different scenarios. We find that for the case of increasing stiffness or preferred curvature, curvature will be acquired gradually with growth, while for increasing line tension, the lattice must have grown to a certain size before a flat-to-curved transition can occur. At low membrane tension, the critical value for coat stiffness is 30 kBT, for preferred curvature it is 200 nm, and for line tension it is 6 pN. For high membrane tension, critical coat stiffness is 150 kBT and critical preferred curvature is 70 nm. In the mixed case when a coat with finite rigidity but increasing line tension is considered, a cup-to-sphere transition can occur for a line tension of 6 pN. The flat-to-curved and the cup-to-sphere transitions driven by line tension are both suppressed by high membrane tension.},

Due to the complex molecular makeup of the actin cortex, it remains unclear whether actin networks are inherently able to sense and generate membrane curvature, or whether they rely on their diverse binding partners to accomplish this. Here, we show that curvature sensing is an inherent capability of branched actin networks nucleated by Arp2/3 and VCA. We develop a robust method to encapsulate actin inside giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and assemble an actin cortex at the inner surface of the GUV membrane. We show that actin forms a uniform and thin cortical layer when present at high concentration and distinct patches associated with negative membrane curvature at low concentration. Serendipitously, we ﬁnd that the GUV production method also produces dumbbell-shaped GUVs, which we explain using mathematical modeling in terms of membrane hemifusion of nested GUVs. We ﬁnd that branched actin networks preferentially assemble at the neck of the dumbbells, which possess a micrometer-range convex curvature comparable with the curvature of the actin patches found in spherical GUVs. Minimal branched actin networks can thus sense membrane curvature, which may help mammalian cells to robustly recruit actin to curved membranes to facilitate diverse cellular functions such as cytokinesis and migration.},

	abstract = {Animal cells are shaped by a thin layer of actin filaments underneath the plasma membrane known as the actin cortex. This cortex stiffens the cell surface and thus opposes cellular deformation, yet also actively generates membrane protrusions by exerting polymerization forces. It is unclear how the interplay between these two opposing mechanical functions plays out to shape the cell surface. To answer this question, we reconstitute biomimetic actin cortices nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex inside cell-sized lipid vesicles. We show that thin Arp2/3-nucleated actin cortices strongly deform and rigidify the shapes of giant unilamellar vesicles and impart a shape memory on time scales that exceeds the time of actin turnover. In addition, actin cortices can produce finger-like membrane protrusions, showing that Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization forces alone are sufficient to initiate protrusions in the absence of actin bundling or membrane curving proteins. Combining mathematical modeling and our experimental results reveals that the concentration of actin nucleating proteins, rather than actin polymerization speed, is crucial for protrusion formation. This is because locally concentrated actin polymerization forces can drive a positive feedback loop between recruitment of actin and its nucleators to drive membrane deformation. Our work paints a picture where the actin cortex can either drive or inhibit deformations depending on the local distribution of nucleators.},
