I am a theoretical physicist by training and I work primarily in the area of biophysics and soft matter. 

Currently I am an independent <a href="https://nomisfoundation.ch/people/felix-frey/">NOMIS Fellow</a> at <a href="https://ist.ac.at/home">IST Austria</a> in Klosterneuburg where I work together with <a href="https://andelasaric.com">Anđela Šarić</a>. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/bionanoscience/">Department of Bionanoscience</a> of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a> with <a href="https://idemalab.tudelft.nl">Timon Idema</a>,  partially funded by an independently raised Kavli Synergy Granty at the <a href="https://www.kavlifoundation.org/institutes/kavli-institute-of-nanoscience-delft/">Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft</a>. In 2019 I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?lang=e">Institute for Theoretical Physics</a> at <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en">Heidelberg University</a>  in the group of <a href="https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~biophys/">Ulrich Schwarz</a> supported by a scholarship from the <a href="https://hgsfp.physi.uni-heidelberg.de">Heidelberg Graduate School of Fundamental Physics</a>.

Complementary to having been trained in continuum modeling, I am making a transition to particle-based mesoscale computer simulations in my current postdoc, which allows me to bridge scales. In my work, I study self-assembly and remodeling processes at biomembranes to develop a comprehensive understanding of biological systems.
