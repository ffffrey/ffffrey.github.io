I am a theoretical physicist by training and work primarily in <strong>theoretical biophysics and soft matter</strong>.


Currently, I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/soft-matter-and-biological-physics">Soft Matter and Biological Physics Group</a> in the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/applied-physics-and-science-education">Department of Applied Physics and Science Education</a> at <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/">Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)</a>.
Before joining TU/e, I was an independent <a href="https://nomisfoundation.ch/people/felix-frey/">NOMIS Fellow</a> at <a href="https://ist.ac.at/home">IST Austria</a> near Vienna, where I worked with <a href="https://andelasaric.com">Anđela Šarić</a>, and a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/bionanoscience/">Department of Bionanoscience</a> at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a> with <a href="https://www.idemalab.tudelft.nl/">Timon Idema</a>. This work was partially funded by an independently raised Kavli Synergy Grant at the <a href="https://www.kavlifoundation.org/institutes/kavli-institute-of-nanoscience-delft/">Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft</a>. In 2019, I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?lang=e">Institute for Theoretical Physics</a> at <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en">Heidelberg University</a> in the group of <a href="https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~biophys/">Ulrich Schwarz</a>, supported by a scholarship from the <a href="https://hgsfp.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/aboutus/">Heidelberg Graduate School of Fundamental Physics</a>.
In my research, I use a combination of continuum modeling and coarse-grained computer simulations to address a wide range of problems. Currently, I focus on self-assembly and remodeling processes at fluid lipid membranes, with the aim of developing a comprehensive understanding of biological systems.
