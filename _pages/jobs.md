<strong>Join us!</strong> We are continuously looking for motivated colleagues at all levels, particularly students interested in Bachelor End Projects or Master End Projects, as well as PhD students and postdoctoral researchers.

All our projects are related to <strong>Theoretical Biophysics</strong>, using methods from theoretical physics, statistical physics, soft matter physics, and computational physics. A keen interest in biological questions approached with methods from theoretical physics, as well as curiosity and enthusiasm for working closely with experimental collaborators, is therefore highly advantageous.
Depending on the specific project, experience with stochastic dynamics, nonlinear dynamics, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations can be a plus.
We offer excellent working conditions on the vibrant campus of TU/e in Eindhoven, at the heart of the Brainport region, dedicated mentoring and supervision, and many opportunities to learn and grow.

A <strong>PhD student position</strong> in my group in the
<a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/applied-physics-and-science-education">Department of Applied Physics and Science Education</a> at
<a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/">Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)</a>
will be available in <strong>Fall 2026</strong>. Further details will be announced soon.

Interested in doing a <strong>postdoc</strong> with us? Although we currently have no open positions, we strongly encourage prospective candidates to consider applying for external funding (e.g. a <a href="https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/calls/msca-postdoctoral-fellowships-2026">Marie Curie fellowship</a>) together with us. Feel free to contact <strong>Felix Frey (f.f.f.frey1 [at] tue [dot] nl)</strong> for more details.
